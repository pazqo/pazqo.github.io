# A small Euler Sudoku

Let's go through a step-by-step solve of this cute little puzzle.
It's not incredibly hard, but it has a nice mathematical structure. There will be spoilers ahead, so proceed with caution.

Let's take a look at the puzzle and the rules:

Rules:
- 4x4 **Euler** Sudoku rules apply: Place the digits 1-4 and 4 different colors exactly once in each row, column, and box such that each cell has a digit and a color.
  Every digit/color combination must appear exactly once.
- Digits along thermometers increase from the bulb end.
- The digit in the gray circle is odd.

We will discuss thermo restrictions in detail in a different post. For now, this only means that <Cell r='1' c='2'/> < <Cell r='2' c='3'/> and <Cell r='2' c='2'/> < <Cell r='3' c='3'/>.
The odd restriction means that <Cell r='3' c='4'/> is 1 or 3. We will only use these information later in the solve.

The most important interesting restriction is that this Sudoku is actually a **Euler** Sudoku, which is strictly related to Graeco-Latin squares. We'll take a look at that restrictin in more detail.

# Graeco-Latin square

This is a pretty rare Sudoku, as it's extremely restricted. Let's take a look at more generic problem of **Graeco-Latin square**, or **orthogonal Latin squares**.

Given a *nxn* square and an alphabeth with *n* symbols, we can form a latin square if each rown and each column contain a set of the symbols of the alphabeth. In the Sudoku, we also require that this is true for each region.

Given a *nxn* square and two alphabets (in our case numbers and colors) with *n* symbols, we want to arrange a pair of symbols in each cell such that when restricting to a single alphabeth we get a latin square, and no pair is repeated.
This extra contraint make the job more difficult. A solution, straight from wikipedia is this one:

<div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center'}}>

  />

</div>

This is not a valid sudoku for Latin letters (A, B repeat in the first region) but would be a valid sudoku for greek letters. We want 


<Spoiler title="Think about it first...">
  The answer is **45**.

  A quick way to calculate: pair up 1+9, 2+8, 3+7, 4+6 = four pairs of 10, plus the 5 in the middle.

  So: 4 × 10 + 5 = 45

You can nest multiple hints for a step-by-step reveal:

<Spoiler title="Hint 1">
  Try pairing numbers from opposite ends.

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">
  Each pair sums to the same value.

<Spoiler title="Final answer">
  1+9 = 2+8 = 3+7 = 4+6 = **10**
