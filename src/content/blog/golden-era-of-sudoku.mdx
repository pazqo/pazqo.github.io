# The Golden Era of Sudoku

2020 was an infamous year for many reasons. But it also sparked a creative renaissance—people stuck at home discovered new hobbies, new content creators, and new obsessions. For me, that obsession was Sudoku variants.

This post is the first in a series where I'll explore modern Sudoku: what makes it different from the newspaper puzzles of the 2000s, why it's captured such a passionate community, and why I think it's a fascinating testbed for artificial intelligence.

It all started with this video:

This is [Cracking the Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/@CrackingTheCryptic), a YouTube channel hosted by Simon Anthony & Mark Goodliffe—two world-class puzzlers who solve Sudokus live, unedited, thinking out loud. This particular video, the Miracle Sudoku, went viral and jump-started what I call the Golden Era of Sudoku. But to understand why it's so remarkable, let's first revisit the basics.

## Super short story of Sudoku

Sudoku is a classic [paper-and-pencil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper-and-pencil_game) game, which traditionally consists of a grid of 9 rows and 9 columns. There are also bold lines that identify 9 3x3 boxes, and _givens_: digits that are already placed and serve as clues for the rest of the solve.
The task for the solver is to fill each cell with a number from 1 to 9, such that each row and each column contains all different digits (Latin square), and all 3x3 boxes have the same property. The solution must be unique.

It was allegedly invented by Euler around 1750, then published sporadically in the US in 1979 and in Japan in 1984 by Nikoli. The mainstream effect came pretty late, in 2005.
Everybody was solving Sudoku puzzles in the newspaper. The popularity was astounding. And yet, despite all these years, we had to wait until 2020 for the next big thing.

The [math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_Sudoku) behind classic Sudoku is very well understood; there are plenty of algorithms to solve most puzzles (even a [Singapore PM published his own algorithm](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32591984)!).
For example, it is well known that the minimum number of clues must be 17, as no Sudoku with 16 givens can have a unique solution.

As with many things (e.g., Rubik's Cube), once the math is exhausted, enter the speedsolvers, which in my opinion takes away half the fun.
But at the same time, to avoid stagnation, some basic Sudoku variants were introduced. This was the first step.

## Sudoku Variations

A _Sudoku Variant_ is a Sudoku puzzle where we (usually) get the standard Sudoku rules plus some extra constraint. A pretty famous example is [Killer Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_sudoku), where we add _cages_: areas of contiguous cells with a number in the top-left corner.
This number is the sum of the cells in the cage. We also usually require that all the cells in a cage are different. In such a puzzle, you might remove one or more clues, hence being able to go below the minimum 17. In fact, in the [Wikipedia example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_sudoku#/media/File:Killersudoku_color.svg) there are no givens.
But in that very same example, we have plenty of cages that could be removed and still yield a unique solution (you can play one example [here](https://sudokupad.app/fpuzN4IgzglgXgpiBcBOANCALhNAbO8QGkIscAnAAgGUBXAEwHsBrATxFQEMq0ALOkhEAA5soARzqsQJKjjAw0%2FACIQA5pjBkIAOzJsyAYzbKYZMFQC2ZNHUtdjm8wCMY5LTeNWBAWhwAzNPt5NZwA6MiVVNHV6Mk06fxIYARg2f1ddAyNgiWUSCBoEAG0C4ABfZFLysorqqtrKgF1kYrqayrbW0sbm9pbenq6OvsGGpuGx3oGhqf7R6fGR7vnxyZ7V5caQBiJSDNxikD0YYjBCkAAlAEYAYQBmCUurgBZ764BWEA2ANzYsKlwQC7vKoHI5YE7wArna4ANnuACYru9UGcEbDkTdER9UN9fv84XCQMDDsdTmcMXd0U97o8qV8fn9%2BIhCeUQSSIecMQB2e4YgAc1Ku3LpuP4cIADMzQMSwaSMWjzjT5WdXldYcKGXh%2BUTQeDIcqqcjoQbzpzadj6XiJdq2XqaRd7ir7er%2FrDrTL2WdeVcCcjEN6sSAcRqQFqWdLdecvRTzn67s7%2BBdXWGdaTTUjI8bPZjfWbAxaE1bkzaTVd%2BcjTUzkV6yxmmfG8Bdnm6I2cjUrTe3BQGg5bJaz3XrrvbkdcCfWQHdm6SEcPzgifRyrrOyf7x3CgUWBwrs%2BcVenW5jxxduVOPUbuYbS9383gk1KUx6VQv9dGD2PzSKG5PNy3rpW51c%2F4rkBNJ1h%2BwaAn24akkar6ms%2BppxuBLpQQ%2Bep%2BvufpKn6QrIQmk71CUQA%3D%3D%3D)).
This opened the way to new forms of minimalism and reasoning (e.g., a cage with 3 cells and 8 in the top-left corner can contain 1-2-5 or 1-3-4, and this ambiguity needs to be resolved somewhere else).

Another pretty standard variant is Sudoku X, where both diagonals must also contain all digits 1 to 9. This is a minor variant, but it still allows for fewer givens.

As you can see, with variants the reasoning gets more creative; you need to develop a new set of tools to solve these puzzles.

So, in general, a _Sudoku Variant_ is a puzzle that has the same basic logic as Sudoku, fewer givens, and extra rules. The rules do not need to be previously codified and explained somewhere else, but they should lead to a clear solution path with no need for guessing.

## The Miracle Sudoku

I stopped caring about Sudoku in 2006; it was mainstream and didn't hold my interest. I moved on to other puzzles. Fast forward to 2020, COVID times—I stumbled upon the Miracle Sudoku video.

Simon called it "Miracle" because it has only 2 givens. Two! He was about to dismiss it as an April Fool's joke, but it turned out to be completely solvable—and beautiful. Let's take a look:

We know that this will not be solvable unless we have enough restrictions coming from the rules. So here are the rules:

- Any two cells separated by a **knight**'s move or a **king**'s move (in chess) must contain different digits.
- Any two orthogonally adjacent cells cannot contain **consecutive** digits.

**That's it**. These simple constraints are enough to force a unique solution with just 2 givens. You can imagine why Simon was baffled—and so was I. This is what hooked me on Sudoku variants.

The amazing thing is that this puzzle isn't extremely difficult once you internalize the rules. Try it yourself:

After that, I was hooked. I started watching Cracking the Cryptic every night before sleeping—it hit just the right spot where it was challenging but never felt impossible.

What makes Simon and Mark special is their approach: they solve in real time, unedited, thinking out loud. No magic, just deductions. You can pause, try to find the next step yourself, then watch them explain their reasoning. It's like having a puzzle mentor.

For a long time I was just an observer, too intimidated to try puzzles myself. When I did attempt them, I failed miserably. Then something clicked in 2022—two years after I started watching—and I finally solved my first variant.

## The Community

Where do all these puzzles come from? Most of what Simon and Mark solve is submitted by the community, and the main hub is [Logic Masters Germany](https://logic-masters.de/). This site hosts thousands of hand-crafted puzzles, rated by difficulty.

When I started solving on my own, I looked for "GAS" puzzles (Genuinely Approachable Sudoku). Here's one of my early solves—[Absolute GAS](https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=00093B) by FullDeck-Missing, a gentle introduction to Thermo Sudoku:

But was I just in a filter bubble? The community *felt* like it was exploding, but maybe that was just my newfound obsession talking. Then I found this chart:

<PuzzleStep

Puzzle submissions to Logic Masters went up *tenfold* in 2020 ([source](https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Statistik/allgemein.php)). We're now at around 500 new puzzles per month—roughly 15 per day. This isn't a niche hobby anymore; it's a genuine movement.

## Sudoku Variants as an A(G)I Benchmark

Here's where my two passions collide: puzzles and artificial intelligence.

I've long believed that Sudoku variants require a particular kind of intelligence —one where you can't just apply memorized rules, but must adapt, think creatively, discard dead ends, and navigate a vast space of possible reasoning paths. Experience matters: the more puzzles you solve, the more you recognize how different rules interact. This feels closer to General Intelligence (at least in the puzzle domain) than classic Sudoku ever could, where the math is fully understood and brute-force algorithms reign supreme.

Having participated in the [ARC-AGI Challenge](https://arcprize.org/) (11th place worldwide!), I've been thinking about this connection for a while. So I was thrilled when [Sakana.ai](https://sakana.ai/company-info/), a Japanese AI company, released a Sudoku [benchmark](https://pub.sakana.ai/sudoku/) specifically designed to test A(G)I capabilities. Their dataset includes:

- 100 handmade puzzles by [Nikoli](https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/)
- 2,565 puzzles featured on the Cracking the Cryptic YouTube channel (complete with solve transcripts and step-by-step grid manipulations)
- 100 benchmark Sudokus ranging from 4x4 to 9x9, plus 20 of Nikoli's most difficult puzzles

The key idea is to *evaluate models on diverse logical and creative reasoning* without relying on solvers or external tools—just raw LLM capabilities. I find this approach compelling: good puzzle-solving rarely requires exhaustive search. Instead, it demands clever deductions and *asking the right questions*. More on that later.

Of course, even the most capable LLM needs to learn the basics first—understanding common variants and developing intuition for which constraints simplify the solution path. And frankly, so do humans.

## What's Next

This post was an introduction—the "why" of modern Sudoku. In upcoming posts, I'll dive into the "how":

- **Common variant types**: Thermos, Killer cages, German Whispers, and more
- **Fundamental techniques**: How to spot patterns and build deductive chains
- **The art of constraint**: Why fewer givens can actually make puzzles *easier* to reason about
- **AI and puzzles**: What LLMs get right, what they struggle with, and what that tells us about intelligence

Whether you're a curious beginner or an AI researcher looking for reasoning benchmarks, I hope you'll find something useful. Stay tuned.
