# Sudoku Variations: Killer Sudoku

Killer Sudoku is perhaps the most famous Sudoku variant, and for good reason: it elegantly combines the logic of classic Sudoku with arithmetic, creating puzzles that feel fresh while remaining accessible to newcomers.

## The Rules

In Killer Sudoku, the grid is divided into groups of cells called **cages**, typically outlined with dotted lines. Each cage has a small number in the top-left corner indicating the **sum** of the digits within that cage. Two additional rules apply:

1. **The digits in each cage must sum to the indicated total**
2. **Digits cannot repeat within a cage** (even if the cage spans multiple rows, columns, or boxes)

Standard Sudoku rules still apply: each row, column, and 3x3 box must contain the digits 1-9 exactly once.

In general, a cage 

## Minimals and maximals properties


In some cases, the numers inside a cage cannot be guessed without further constraints (e.g. a 3-cage summing to 15). But there are cases where can can determine at least some of the numbers that must appear in a cage. It's useful to think about min-max

- No cage can have more than 9 cells: by pigeonhole principle, if you have more cells at least one number must repeat
- Cages with 8 cells are uniquely determined: if the cage had 9 cells, the sum would be 45 (=1+2+...+9); since we only have 8, one digit must be missing, and that digit is 45 - *s*, where *s* is the number in the top-left corner (that must be between 45-9 = 36 and 45-1 = 44)
- For each cage size, we have a minimum and a maximum possible value: both minimum and maximum are uniquely determined; here's a list of mins and maxs:
  - 2 cells: 3 (=1+2) to 17 (=9+8)
  - 3 cells: 6 (=1+2+3) to 24 (=9+8+7)
  - 4 cells: 10 (=1+...+4) to 30 (=9+...+6)
  - 5 cells: 15 (=1+...+5) to 35 (=9+...+5)
  - 6 cells: 21 (=1+...+6) to 39 (=9+...+4)
  - 7 cells: 28 (=1+...+7) to 42 (=9+...+3)
  - 8 cells: 36 (=1+...+8) to 44 (=9+...+2)
- Minimum+1 (or maximum-1) is also uniquely determined: you can move from sum s to sum s+1 (or s-1) by increasing (decreasing) exactly one value; there is only one value you can increase (decrease) without creating a duplicate, so from 1+2+3 you can only get 1+2+4.
- Minimum+2 (or maximum-2) is not uniquely determined: you can move from s to s+2 (or s-2) by increasing (decreasing) one value by 2 or by increasing two separate values by 1, e.g. 1+2+3 -> 1+2+5 or 1+3+4.


The most fundamental skill in Killer Sudoku is knowing your **cage combinations**. Some sums have only one possible combination:

- **3 in 2 cells**: must be 1-2
- **4 in 2 cells**: must be 1-3
- **16 in 2 cells**: must be 7-9
- **17 in 2 cells**: must be 8-9
- **6 in 3 cells**: must be 1-2-3
- **24 in 3 cells**: must be 7-8-9

These "forced" combinations are your entry points into the puzzle.
