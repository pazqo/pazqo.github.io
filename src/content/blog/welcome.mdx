# Welcome to My Blog

Welcome to my new React-powered blog! This site has been completely rebuilt using modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe components
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development and builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **React Router** with HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility
- **MDX** support for writing blog posts in Markdown with React components

## Features

The new site includes several interactive features:

- Dark/Light theme toggle with localStorage persistence
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Interactive Sudoku puzzle renderer
- MDX blog with syntax highlighting

Stay tuned for more posts about puzzles, programming, and mathematics!
